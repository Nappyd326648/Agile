# Agile
Threw user stories and communication with the user we are able to set pass or fail condition. The pass or fail is how the developer understand the user needs and wants. User stories has information like the size of the user story, the action the user wants to do, and the results the user would like to see. Agile allows me to to approach developing programs by using sprints to complete the program and get it out to the user. Sprints are composed of user stories that the team will work on. To be a good team member in software development is to be honest with the team. Honest communication is a key part of an agile team because agile is tracked by sprint progress, so if a user story is is taking longer than it should the team needss to know about it to solve it.
